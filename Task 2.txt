2 Task ( Screencast explanation of demo & code  ) 

Creating a screencast for explaining the demo and code implementation for an out-patient appointment system would be a great way to provide a comprehensive overview of the project. Here's a suggested structure for your screencast:

1. Introduction:
   - Briefly introduce yourself and the purpose of the screencast.
   - Mention that you'll be demonstrating the implementation of API endpoints for an out-patient appointment system.

2. Overview of the Project:
   - Provide a high-level overview of the project, including its goals and objectives.
   - Explain the technology stack used (e.g., Java, Spring Boot, etc.).

3. Demo:
   - Walk through the implementation of API endpoints for the out-patient appointment system.
   - Show the directory structure of the project.
   - Demonstrate how to run the project locally.

4. API Endpoints Explanation:
   - Explain each API endpoint in detail:
     - Doctors Listing Endpoint
     - Doctor Detail Endpoint
     - Availability Endpoint
     - Appointment Booking Endpoint
   - Discuss the HTTP methods used for each endpoint (e.g., GET, POST).
   - Show sample requests and responses for each endpoint.

5. Code Walkthrough:
   - Dive into the codebase and explain key components of the implementation.
   - Highlight important classes, methods, and configurations.
   - Discuss any design patterns or architectural decisions made.

6. Testing:
   - Briefly discuss the importance of testing in software development.
   - Show how to test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.
   - Demonstrate a sample test case for each endpoint.

7. Conclusion:
   - Summarize the key points covered in the screencast.
   - Encourage viewers to explore the code further on GitHub.
   - Thank viewers for watching and invite them to provide feedback.

Make sure to speak clearly and at a moderate pace during the screencast. You can use screen recording software like OBS Studio, Camtasia, or QuickTime Player to record your demo and code walkthrough. Once recorded, you can upload the screencast to a platform like YouTube and include the link in your GitHub repository's README.md file for easy access.
